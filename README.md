Cute Robot Responsive Website
This project is a simple, interactive, and responsive website where a cute robot character moves its head/eyes/body based on the user’s mouse movements. The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is designed to be responsive across devices.

Features
Interactive robot character that follows the user’s mouse movement.

Smooth animations for a natural and playful effect.

Fully responsive layout that adjusts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Lightweight, with no external frameworks required.

Technologies Used
HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for styling and responsiveness

JavaScript (Vanilla) for interactivity

Project Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cute-robot-website.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
cd cute-robot-website
Open index.html in your browser to preview the website.

How It Works
The robot is created with either SVG shapes or div elements styled with CSS.

Using JavaScript event listeners, the robot’s eyes/head/body track the mouse position with a smooth transition effect.

For smaller screens (mobile and tablet), the robot re-sizes and centers itself automatically thanks to responsive CSS rules.

Demo Controls
Move your mouse across the screen → the robot’s eyes and head follow.

Resize the browser window → layout adjusts responsively.

Future Enhancements
Add blinking or idle animations when the mouse stays still.

Make the robot respond to touch gestures on mobile.

Add a playful background or sound effects.

Would you like me to also generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that makes the robot follow the mouse, so your README has a working project attached?
